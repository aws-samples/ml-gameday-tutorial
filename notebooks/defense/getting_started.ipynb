    "You will be creating a model that creates the layout of ships at the begining of each game. The following will describe the rules of your endpoint and the following notebook will show the details of implementing your endpoint. This repo has code implementing three types of models; a random layout with ships of size 2, layout that chooses ships of size 2 or 3, and a model that places ships away from the initial shots of other teams. \n",
