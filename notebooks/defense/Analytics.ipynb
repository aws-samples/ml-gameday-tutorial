    "Your first model just randomly places ships of size 2. Since you can make ships of many different shapes we would like to find what is the best shape. You also need to change the shape of your ships since other teams shooting models will learn the patterns of your layout. In this model, each game your model will choose one of two different layout strategies and you will then use [Amazon Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/) to see the results. You can then repeate the experiment with new ship sizes and shapes to see if you can find better strategies. "
