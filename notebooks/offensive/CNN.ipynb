Increase the Width and Depth hyperparameters will make your model more powerful and give you a higher dice score (but will take longer to train)\n",

This will give you a good estimate of the training throughput which you can then use to adjust how many epochs to train your next model. Too low and your model does not learn enough, too long and your model never finished in time to gain you points. As a team you will need to decided how long you want to train a model for. Note, increasing the width and depth hyperparamters will decrease your throughput but using a larger instance type will increase the throughput. "
