    "Your team will create ML models to play \"AI Command\" which is like battleships! (aka you sunk my battleship) Each team will have a board they place their ships on and will try to guess the placement of the opposing team's ships. During each round of guess the teams will pick a location on the opposing teams board which will be revealed as either a hit or miss. The first team to find all of the opposing teams ships wins!\n",

    "    - Ships: Ships can be any shape as long as they follow the constraints given for the scenario. The details of these constraints will be in the Layout Endpoint Instructions\n",
    "- __shoot__: Teams will take one shot at a time until one of the following happens:\n",
    "    1. one team sinks all the ships of the opposing team\n",
    "    2. The max number of shooting rounds is reached. The Max number of shooting rounds is equal to the area of the game board. So if a Game Board is 10x10 then their are max 100 shots per team per game\n",
